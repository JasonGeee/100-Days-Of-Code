## Day 5

Writing **Clean Code and Clean Comments** are so important for yourself and the next developer reading your code or you reading someone else's code. Main reason why it is a must is to help readable and understanding without having to ask many questions or even going back to the code and rewriting someone's code.

Reading about writing clean code and comments brings up how important code can come across very easily if it is clean. Some functions don't need explination this just the name of the function or variable.

### Rule of Thumb for Writing Clean Code
    
    1) *Indentation* should be consisten throughout the code.
    2) *Semicolons*, just do it! Keeps code clean without errors (unless using Python3)
    3) *Line Length* should be simple and short. Not too long, or else becomes too heckteck. Clean indentation the same.
    4) *Naming Things*, functions and variables should be descriptive.
        - Functions: **stay with verbs**
        - Variables: **stay with nouns or an adjective(phrase)**

### Knowledge Check for Clean Code

- Why is it important to write clean code?

Important to help readablility and understanding of the code. Otherwise can be too confusing.

- Name 5 clean code principles previously mentioned

    1) Write comments explaining why, Code that can explain how.
    2) Use correct indentation
    3) Revist logic with diagrams or pseudocode
    4) Use standard naming of functions and variables
    5) Avoid large functions

- What is the difference between good comments and bad comments?

Good comments are short and simple that explain why. Gets straight to the point professionally.
