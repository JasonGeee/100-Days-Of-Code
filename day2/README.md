## Day 2

Today I learned about problem solving. As what any programmer should be learning.

# Knowledge Check on Problem Solving of TOP

- What are the three stages in the problem solving process?

Three stages:

1) Understand (the problem)
2) Plan (plan out a solution in pseudocode)
3) Divide (and conquer)

- Why is it important to clearly understand the problem first?

Understanding the problem first allows us to solve the problem much better than trying to tackle it straight on.

- What can you do to help get a clearer understanding of the problem?

Write it down on paper(or whiteboard), talk to someone about the problem, ask yourself or someone some questions.

- What are some of the things you should do in the planning stage of the problem solving process?

Ask questions like: What are the inputs, outputs, user interface, data that needs to be entered (by user?), what are the steps needed tor return our desired output

- What is an algorithm?

An algorithm is a recipe/solution to a particular problem.

- What is pseudo code?

Pseudocode is plain language explaining the process/solution to a problem. Kind of like comments.

- What are the advantages of breaking a problem down and solving the smaller problems?

The advantage of doing so is allowing us to think about the problem in subsections. Breaking it down into subsections and subsolutions for each brings a better chance of solving the problem rather than being stuck for hours.
