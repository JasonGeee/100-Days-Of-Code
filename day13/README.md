# Day 13

Been lacking it the past 2 days but going to try and get back on track. I have been watching Youtube videos on more DOM and Event types. Doing my best to learn more about this concept as it is very important to how a website can be very interactive.

Watched the 4 part series crash course on Javascript DOM by Traversy Media.

Going back to revisiting the Rock-Paper-Scissors project to allow DOM manipulation with buttons!
