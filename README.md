# 100-Days-Of-Code
Coding for 100 days straight is my goal! I want to become a Software Engineer so I want to document everything I am learning.

I am an alumni at California State University, Long Beach with a degree in Computer Engineering.
I want to continue to develop my knowledge in programming to grasp a better understanding.
I am learning about Web Development.

I think the best way for learning new technologies is to document what you are learning in that timeframe. So creating a github to document
my progress seems like the best way to grasp the knowledge.

I plan to learn from 

- The Odin Project [webpage](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
- Other online resources (Youtube, Google, Open Sources)

But here and there I will be throwing in some other coding practice. Like touching up on my C++ or C programming.

## Day 1

Committing to the 100 days of code for an hour or more a day!
Making the github page to push into the repository to help document everyday of my coding journey.

## Day 2

Learning about problem solving. As any programmer should have a skill that can solve coding problems.
