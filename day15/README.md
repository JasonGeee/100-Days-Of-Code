## Day 15

Been slacking a bit on documenting but got COVID-19 and didn't feel well even with the vaccine and booster. But do feel better now and will do my best to get back on track!

Didn't document past few days but have been working on the Etch-A-Sketch project. Finished up on it today.

Things I was able to get done with the project:

- Create a grid with user input from 1 - 64
- Grid doesn't surpass the container (was having trouble with this problem)
- Created a reset button that refreshes the page and goes back to square one of the webpage.
- Doesn't allow any invalid user input.
