## Day 1

1/12/2022

I have already started on The Odin Project Full Stack Bootcamp online.
So far I am on the Foundations > Javascript > Fundamentals Part 3.

I already learned about the past couple days:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript (basics of the language)

But in the Fundamentals part 3, I've learned about:

- Functions (calls and return)
- Function Scope
- Return values
- Arrow Function

I know the fundamentals of programming already so nothing new here on learning besides the arrow function that is built in
Javascript. It is like relearning the basics but in a little more fast paced in my speed of going through it.
