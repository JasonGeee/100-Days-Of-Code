## Day 4

Creating a Rock Paper Scissors website! For now only using HTML and Javascript. No CSS as for now to get a better grasp of JS programming. Since this is the first real project with Javascript, I am very excited to see how it turns out!

If you want to see the project repo, I will link it below.
