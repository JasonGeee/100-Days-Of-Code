# 100-Days-Of-Code
Coding for 100 days straight is my goal!

I am an alumni at California State University, Long Beach with a degree in Computer Engineering.
I want to continue to develop my knowledge in programming to grasp a better understanding.
I am learning about Web Development.

I plan to learn from 

- The Odin Project
- Other online resources (Youtube, Google, Open Sources)

## Day 1

Committing to the 100 days of code for an hour or more a day!
Making the github page to push into the repository to help document everyday of my coding journey.
